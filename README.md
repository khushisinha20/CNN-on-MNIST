# CNN on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to the MNIST dataset for image classification. The CNN architecture consists of:

- **Convolutional Layer:** A 2D convolutional layer with 32 filters and ReLU activation.
- **Pooling Layer:** A max-pooling layer for downsampling.
- **Fully Connected Layer:** A dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer:** The final dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation for multiclass classification.

The code showcases how to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, build this CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, compile the model, and train it on the training data for 10 epochs.
